<h1 class="text">About Me</h1>
<p class="text">
    My name is Collin, and I am a second-year student at Rice University passionate about the intersection between technology and business.
    I am currently pursuing a dual degree with a B.A. in Business and a B.S. in Computer Science (plus a minor in Entrepreneurship).
    In addition to my academic pursuits, I love running, exploring the outdoors, pickleball, reading, travel, and music.
    <br><br>
    My fascination with computers started when I was seven when I enrolled in an after-school program focused on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/54329/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.
    I was amazed by how I could make <i>something</i> happen on the screen simply by moving some blocks around. From there, I taught myself JavaScript through a combination of YouTube tutorials, Stack Overflow, and W3Schools.
    <br><br>
    This is when I started working with <a href="https://discord.com/users/480913404094054402" target="_blank">Discord</a>. I learned how to interact with its API and started creating simple bots that reacted to chat-based commands.
    I loved all of the cool things you could do with these bots and their ability to interact with many facets of the Internet. This led to me learning how to work with a variety of APIs and integrate them into larger projects.
    <br><br>
    Around the same time I started high school, I started my own freelance development firm specializing in creating Discord bots for server owners. This began with tailored cold-messaging and quickly accelerated to constant connections and referrals.
    Through this firm, I led a team of seven developers, graphic designers, and moderators and developed projects for notable companies such as Wendy's, Taco Bell, Coachella, MKBHD, Terraria, and WorldBox.
    <br><br>
    Now, I am focusing primarily on my studies at Rice University to become an even stronger developer. While I am here, I am also focusing on a few smaller passion projects such as this portfolio and developing a "device" that allows me to unlock my dorm door using my phone.
    <br><br>
    That's my past for now. I look forward with excitement to all that is left for me in the future.
